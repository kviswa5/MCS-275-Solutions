A few of these images have already been drawn by various artists, and those artists were free to choose any colors they liked when doing so.  Here are links to those images:\n",

    "Your task is to analyze the existing images and generate a list of the distinct colors that are used in them.  Ideally, the list should be ordered from most-frequently used colors (in terms of number of pixels) to least-frequently used.  However, if sorting by frequency proves to be too complicated, it's acceptable to simply produce a list of distinct colors in arbitrary order.\n",

    "241,231,108\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. An image file `palette.png` that is created by the program in which 32 of the colors are shown in a horizontal strip, with each one represented by a 16x64 (width x height) pixel rectangle filled with that color.  (Thus the image has dimensions 512x64.)  Here's a sample of what it might look like, but this sample doesn't show the colors listed above nor colors that necessarily appear in the sample images.\n",

    "        if c1==c2:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "    return False\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the worst case, this function performs `len(s2)` checks, and it runs for each character of `s1`.  If `s1` and `s2` are each of length 50,000, then this becomes 2,500,000,000 equality checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most strings don't have that many distinct characters, so it would be faster to:\n",
    "* Find all of the distinct characters in `s1` (and make a set out of them)\n",
    "* Find all of the distinct characters in `s2` (and make a set out of them)\n",
    "* Check which characters lie in both of these sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The time it takes to do this would be roughly proportional to `len(s1) + len(s2) + n1*n2` where `n1` is the number of distinct characters in `s1` and `n2` is the number of distinct characters in `s2`.  In most cases `n1` and `n2` will be bounded by a fixed constant (like `26`, if the strings only contain lower case letters of the alphabet), so the main contribution to the running time is proportional to the lengths of `s1` and `s2` individually, rather than their product.\n",
